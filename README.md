Stock Prediction Model
Overview
This repository contains my initial stock predicting model, developed as part of my journey into machine learning. The model aims to forecast stock market trends by leveraging various machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques.

Project Goals
Understand Stock Market Dynamics: Gain insights into the factors influencing stock prices.
Model Development: Create a predictive model using historical stock data.
Improve Accuracy: Identify areas for enhancement to increase the model's predictive accuracy over time.
Current Status
While the model's accuracy is still in development, this project serves as a foundation for applying machine learning principles and exploring advanced techniques such as feature engineering and data preprocessing.

Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Future Improvements
As I progress in my machine learning journey, I plan to implement:

Advanced algorithms for better predictions
Enhanced feature engineering strategies
Model validation and performance evaluation techniques
Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or contribute to the project!
